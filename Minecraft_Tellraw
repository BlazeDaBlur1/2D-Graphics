I have a tellraw command in minecraft and all of the text appears but upon clicking the text I want all players to die. 
But instead of all players dying nothing happens. 
Here is my command: 
tellraw @a {"text":"Kill all people?""color":"green","clickEvent":{CommandValue":"/kill @a"}} 
Any help would be so useful. Thank you.
